# External Services

## Database - Supabase
- Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vtcxyktxeplpjgqjefqg
- Used for: production Postgres (via `DATABASE_URL`)
- `.env` variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_DATABASE_PASS`
- Free tier note: pauses after inactivity, just visit dashboard to wake it up
- Only using raw Postgres connection, NOT their Auth/Storage/PostgREST features or any backend services

## Image Storage - Cloudinary
- Dashboard: https://console.cloudinary.com/app/settings/api-keys
- Used for: service images, QR codes (stored under "herco-qr" folder)
- `.env` variables: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- Free tier note: no auto-delete on inactivity, data persists

## Session Store, OTP, & Abuse Prevention - Upstash Redis
- Dashboard: https://console.upstash.com
- `.env` variables: `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN`
- Used for:
  1. Session storage (all logged-in users - customer/staff/admin) - see src/app.js UpstashSessionStore
  2. OTP codes for password reset & email change (10 min TTL)
  3. Booking abuse prevention - temporary 2-hour block after 3 cancelled bookings within 1 hour (per IP and per user)
- Free tier note: AUTO-DELETES after 14 days inactivity - recreate if needed, update .env after
- IMPORTANT: if Redis is down/deleted, ALL active user sessions break too, not just booking limits
- To reset a demo ban manually, run `FLUSHDB` against the Redis instance

## Payments - Xendit
- Dashboard: https://dashboard.xendit.co
- Used for: booking payments
- `.env` variables: `XENDIT_SECRET_KEY`, `XENDIT_PUBLIC_KEY`
- Currently using TEST/sandbox keys
- Webhook URL must be manually set in Xendit dashboard (Settings > Webhooks/Callbacks)
  - Format: `{APP_URL}/api/booking/webhook`
  - Example: `https://carita-solar-darci.ngrok-free.dev/api/booking/webhook`
  - IMPORTANT: does NOT auto-sync with `.env`'s `APP_URL` - if `APP_URL` changes (new ngrok tunnel, new deploy), update it manually in Xendit's dashboard too, or payment confirmations won't reach the app

## Email - Brevo
- Dashboard: https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/api
- Used for: booking confirmation emails
- `.env` variable: `BREVO_API_KEY`
- NOTE: Brevo may block API calls from new/unrecognized IPs after the key's initial 30-day "learning phase" ends.
  If emails suddenly stop sending, check for a Brevo security email about a blocked IP and authorize it at:
  Settings > Security > Authorized IPs

## Hosting - Render

- `APP_URL` - `http://localhost:3000` locally; the deployed URL in production (see Xendit webhook note above)
